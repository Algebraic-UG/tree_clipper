# Code of Conduct

This is modelled on the [Blender code of conduct](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/communication/code_of_conduct/).

## Community Guidelines

### Be respectful and considerate:
- Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or personal attacks.
- Remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable is not a productive one.

### Be patient and generous:
- If someone asks for help it is because they need it.
- Do politely suggest specific documentation or more appropriate venues where appropriate, but avoid aggressive or vague responses.

### Assume people mean well:
- Remember that decisions are often a difficult choice between competing priorities.
- If you disagree, please do so politely.
- If something seems outrageous, check that you did not misinterpret it.
- Ask for clarification, but do not assume the worst.

### Try to be concise:
- Avoid repeating what has been said already.
- Making a conversation larger makes it difficult to follow, and people often feel personally attacked if they receive multiple messages telling them the same thing.
