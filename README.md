# Tree Clipper

Easier version control and sharing of node trees via `.json` or copy-pasteable strings.

Sharing node trees between users and in communities usually involves screenshots of node setups (which a user has to try and exactly re-create manually) or `.blend` files which can be cumbersome (and a security risk) to download and append relevant data blocks to scenes.

`Tree Clipper` aims to improve two main workflows:

- Storage of large collections of nodes in `.json` format, so that version control such as `git` can properly track changes in a node tree rather than a single binary `.blend` file
- Sharing of node groups in communities like Discord and Stack Exchange. Users can share a 'magic string' which will be de-serialized into a node tree by the add-on, enabling rapid sharing and collaborating between users

More to come once we actually finish building.
